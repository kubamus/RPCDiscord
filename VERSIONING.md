[Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](http://semver.org/) is a versioning system that uses a three-part format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. This system helps communicate the nature of changes in new software releases. Here's how it works:

- **MAJOR** version (X): Incremented for incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version (Y): Incremented for backward-compatible new features.
- **PATCH** version (Z): Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

For example, version 2.3.4 indicates MAJOR version 2, MINOR version 3, and PATCH version 4. Following SemVer ensures clear communication about software updates and maintains compatibility within your project.
